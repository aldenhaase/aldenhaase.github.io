      <h1>Keyboard</h1>
      <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>In 10,000 years, if all that remained of our civilization was a keyboard, the alien archiologists
        would surly come to the coclusion that humans have 8 finely controled fingers and the two absolutely
        useless club fingers. For afterall, the keyboard assigns ~3 keys per finger and assumes our thumbs
        need to join forces in order to handle the single character they are responsible for. Even the specialty
        keyboards that adress this issue do not take it far enough. The plank ez for example still doubles the 
        width of the space key. By putting my full fiath in my thumbs I am able to  []=- type an additional 5 
        keys from the home position. This is incredibly useful for somebody like myself who spends countless hours
        typing in languages that rely on the set of []{}=+_- charaters. Speaking of efficiency and typing speed, I love VIM.
        I am far from an expert but the little I do know increases my productivity dramatically. I found myself 
        wanting to use VIM **keybindings** everywhere. The time wasted reaching for my mouse to reposition the cursor 
        while writing English was just too much to bear. With a multilayerd keyboard such things were easily addressed.
        Under my hjkl keys are the arrow keys allowing me to navigate with peak efficiency. This could have of course
        been solved using macros but building it into the keyboard means that I have this functionality wherever I go.</p>
