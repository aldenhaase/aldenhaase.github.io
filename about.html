      <h2>Motivation and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been motivated by optimization and by a sense of justice.<br> First optimization &#8212 taking something inefficient and making it run as quick and smooth as possible is highly rewarding.
        When I was young, my mom
        would give me a chore and I would spend 4 times as long trying to come up with a more efficient way to complete the task. Luckily as a grew I realized the inefficiencies
        in trying to always make everything more efficient. However, that drive never went away and eventually helped lead me to writing software. Being raised in the age of the 
        computer, it was not always on my mind. However, once I realized the level of efficiency achieved by
        humanity through the use of computers, I realized that software is where I needed to be. <br><br>More efficiency <i>allows</i> for more prosperity. When I first went looking for answers
        to all of the injustices in the world, I turned to books. I scratched the surface of the myriad of different theories on the causes of, and solution to, injustice. What
        was pervasive was the requirement of enough resources before anything else could be done. It is certainly true that what to do with the resources once they are
        acquired is a point of
        contention. However, efficient utilization and acquisition of the resources is always a good start. It is also where I feel I can contribute the most. <br><br>Software allows me 
        to get the instant gratification of puzzling my way through a difficult problem, while simultaneously contributing to the efficiency of our world; hopefully helping to reduce the 
        amount of injustice in the long run.<br> The little things matter. Being able to order a pizza from your phone without hassle may not seem like world changing software,
        but it matters. If you save each user a minute of their time, overall you could be saving hundreds of thousands of hours collectively, which could then be used for more important
        thing.

    <h2>Formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      <br>My first degree from Colorado State University was in English, with a concentration in rhetoric.
      I've always loved a good story but deconstructing arguments was what I was really interested in.
      I don't mean an argument in the sense of a debate, although that was always interesting as well. I mean an argument in a much broader sense. One of my
      professors gave a stop sign as an example. You can consider a stop sign as an argument and deconstruct it the same way you would with a debate. Why is the sign red? What 
      are the implications of the argument to stop? How will this argument be interpreted by different audiences? What counter arguments might the audience come up with? 
      A sample audience member might disagree with the argument and think that 
      they don't need to stop because cross traffic will stop anyways. The speaker would then need to adjust their argument to account for this. <b>Cross traffic does not stop.</b>
      <br><br>
      
      Many people are surprised when I tell them that I returned to my alma mater to pursue a degree in software engineering after graduating, and I understand the reaction.
      But I have found
      that the two fields are very similar. A computer is like a well intentioned, but highly pedantic, reader. Writing for computers and writing for humans are both 
      dependent on precision and structure. If you are not precise with your argument, the reader is liable to go off and do something unintended. If you are not precise
      with your software, the computer is liable to go off and seg fault (core dumped). If your argument is poorly
      structured, you are likely going to confuse the reader and fail to provide them with the necessary information to understand the current line of reasoning. If your
      software is poorly structured, functions will be run with incorrect parameters and the function will fail.

      With poor structure, individual paragraphs may make sense on their own, yet fail to produce the intended effect of the whole. Individual functions may pass unit testing 
      yet fail during integration testing.<br><br> I think
      the sense that the two fields are disparate comes from the fact that humans are incredibly good at interpreting meaning. However, just because the readers head didn't
      malfunction after reading a paper, does not mean that the paper ran successfully. Good writing requires incredible attention to detail. It requires consideration of the relationship
      between each letter, each word, each sentence, each paragraph. Without an appreciation for both how all the pieces fit together, and a precise understanding
      of how all the parts operate in detail, the end result will not function as intended. The process of writing good software and writing a good paper feels almost identical.
      <br><br>
      So my education has continued to focus on my passion for language, but now my audience can do really cool stuff like control spaceships on future missions to mars.
