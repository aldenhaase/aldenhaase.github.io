      <h2>Motivation and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        It's optimization and a desire to contribute.
        First optimization -- taking something inefficient and making it run as quick 
        and smooth as possible is highly rewarding. When I was young,I would spend 4 hours
        coming up with a way to save 15 minutes.
         I've since realized the inefficiencies in <i>always</i> trying to make <i>everything</i> more efficient,
        but when the time is right, few things are as satisfying. Whether it's an app that lets you
        order delivery with ease, or a search engine that responds in milliseconds, anything that
        optimizes the mundane and leaves time for the interesting, is my jam.
        <br>
        There's a lot of bad things in our world and as much as I've tried, I have yet to come up with any solutions.
        But I believe there are solutions out there. Until I come up with some answers myself,I am
        content contributing through software. If I am able to give whoever has the answers a few more
        minutes to think, because I've made their world a little more efficient, I'll be satisfied.

    <h2>Formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      <br>My first degree from Colorado State University was in English, with a concentration in rhetoric.
      There's nothin wrong with a good story but deconstructing arguments was what I was really interested in.
      I don't mean an argument in the sense of a debate, although that was always interesting as well. I mean an argument in a much broader sense. One of my
      professors gave a stop sign as an example. You can consider a stop sign as an argument and deconstruct it the same way you would with a debate. Why is the sign red? What 
      are the implications of the argument to stop? How will this argument be interpreted by different audiences? What counter arguments might the audience come up with? 
      A sample audience member might disagree with the argument and think that 
      they don't need to stop because cross traffic will stop anyways. The speaker would then need to adjust their argument to account for this. <b>Cross traffic does not stop.</b>
      <br><br>
      
      I am currently working towards a degree in software engineering and I have found
      that the two fields are very similar. A computer is like a well intentioned, but highly pedantic, reader. Writing for computers and writing for humans are both 
      dependent on precision and structure. If you are not precise with your argument, the reader is liable to go off and do something unintended. If you are not precise
      with your software, the computer is liable to go off and seg fault (core dumped). If your argument is poorly
      structured, you are likely going to confuse the reader and fail to provide them with the necessary information to understand the current line of reasoning. If your
      software is poorly structured, functions will be run with incorrect parameters and the function will fail.

      With poor structure, individual paragraphs may make sense on their own, yet fail to produce the intended effect of the whole. Individual functions may pass unit testing 
      yet fail during integration testing.<br><br> I think
      the sense that the two fields are disparate comes from the fact that humans are incredibly good at interpreting meaning. However, just because the readers head didn't
      malfunction after reading a paper, does not mean that the paper ran successfully. Good writing requires incredible attention to detail. It requires consideration of the relationship
      between each letter, each word, each sentence, each paragraph. Without an appreciation for both how all the pieces fit together, and a precise understanding
      of how all the parts operate in detail, the end result will not function as intended. The process of writing good software and writing a good paper feels almost identical.
      <br><br>
      So my education has continued to focus on my passion for language, just the audience has changed.
