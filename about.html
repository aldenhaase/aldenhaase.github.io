      I was first drawn to computer science by a desire to look inside the hat. Everyday I interacted with a box that was more magical than the kind that lets you saw a lady in half.
      For too long I had suspended my disbelief, I needed answers.<br>
      <br>
      As I learned how the tricks were done, a deeper appreciation grew and a feeling of familiarity set in. Being able to build whatever came to mind with nothing 
      more than a text editor was liberating. The reward of solving a particularly tricky problem was intoxicating. Learning how to do both efficiently was were my formal
      education came in. All of these attributes mirror what drew me to my persue my first degree in rhetoric, the main difference was the audience. <br><br>
      My drive is for problem solving, it is language and technology agnostic. However, being able to positively impact an end user certainly boosts my motivation.
